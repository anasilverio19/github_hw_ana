Name: Ana Silverio (she/her)

Research Interest: 
I am interested in fisheries management and the intersects of how the 
fishing communities interacts with the its resource as well as other 
disturbances acting on the communities like extreme events. I am also 
interested in small scalle and artisanal fisheries and how to best address 
their resource needs while protecting both the planet and people. 
Currently working on how extremem events both state influenced like 
pandemics and non-state influenced events like natural diasters affect 
fish abudance/populations
